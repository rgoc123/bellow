The application is a fullstack application that uses Rails for the backend and React-Redux in the frontend. By using rails the application is able to authenticate user login information and handle requests to the database. JSON and jbuilder are used to pass data from the backend into the frontend. React and Redux then create a single page application for fast and seamless navigation.


Updates coming in the near future will include restaurant information on the map markers, a filter for whether a restaurant is open now, and the ability to search for cuisines.

I'm excited for you to explore the app and code, and I welcome any feedback you have!
