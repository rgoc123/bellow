# Bellow!


Welcome to Bellow, a Yelp-like application that gives the power to the people when searching for the best places to eat. In Bellow, you are able to sign up, browse restaurants, write reviews, and filter for the perfect restaurant.

Technologies
The application is a fullstack application that uses Rails for the backend and React-Redux in the frontend. By using rails, the application is able to authenticate user login information and handle requests to the database. JSON and jbuilder are used to pass data from the backend into the frontend. React and Redux then create a single page application for fast and seamless navigation. The app also implements Google Maps uses several of its features, such as tracking latitude/longitude changes and creating markers.

Features
There are several important features beyond being able to see a list of restaurants: user authorization, conditional reviews, and the ability to select of multiple filters. A user is able to write, edit and delete reviews, but with conditions: a user can only leave one write one reviews per restaurant and only when logged in, and they can only edit and delete their own reviews. For filtering, a user is able to use a search bar, price filters, or both at the same time.

Updates coming in the near future will include restaurant information on the map markers, a filter for whether a restaurant is open now, and the ability to search for cuisines.

I'm excited for you to explore the app and code, and I welcome any feedback you have!
